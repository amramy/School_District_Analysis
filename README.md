# School District Analysis

## Project Overview:
In this project we were asked to help Maria rework our analysis with a new dataset of student data which included a school budget column. Our task is to collect, prepare, summarize, drill down, and compare/ contrast data with a written analysis.  

## Summary Review:
After reviewing the data represeted here, there is a total of 14,830 students at 15 different schools. Six of these schools are charter schools the remaining nine are public schools.

##### Some interesting facts include:

* Public schools have the higher average budget.
* Charter schools have the highest math average until 12th grade in which case public schools have a higher math average.
* Charter schools have the top three and bottom two student count.
* Considering Public and Charter schools combined:
    * There is the most students in 10th grade.
    * 9th graders have the best math score average and 11th graders have the best reading score average.
